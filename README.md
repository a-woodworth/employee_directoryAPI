# Employee Directory API Exercise

This exercise uses the Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random “employees,” using that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. Design will be based on the provided mockups--a desktop grid layout of employees showing basic info. When selected, a modal overlay displays a card providing more detailed employee data.
